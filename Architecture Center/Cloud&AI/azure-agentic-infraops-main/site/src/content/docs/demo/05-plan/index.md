:::tip[Editorial Context]
This artifact was produced by the **IaC Planner Agent** (Step 4 of the APEX pipeline).
The IaC Planner translates the architecture assessment and governance constraints into
a concrete Bicep implementation plan — selecting AVM modules, defining dependency ordering,
and establishing a phased deployment strategy with validation gates between phases.
:::

## Plan Overview

Bicep implementation plan for the Malta Catering ordering portal — a lightweight SPA + API
on Azure App Service (S1) with VNet integration and private endpoints, backed by Table
Storage, Key Vault, and a full observability stack. All architecture resources plus a
cost-monitoring budget are covered by AVM modules or native Bicep resources. Deployment
uses a **5-phase** strategy with dependency-ordered sequencing and validation gates
between phases.

**Governance adaptation**: The resource group must carry 9 tags enforced by a
management-group-level Deny policy (`JV-Enforce Resource Group Tags v3`). The
deployment contract expands beyond the default 4-tag model accordingly. Storage
and Key Vault network hardening are audit-only warnings in the current scope
and are set explicitly in IaC for visibility.

## Resource Inventory

| Resource                   | Type                                       | SKU               | AVM Module                                         | Version      | Dependencies                              |

:::note
**AVM coverage**: 11/12 resources use AVM modules. Budget uses a native Bicep resource because
the AVM budget module (`avm/res/consumption/budget/mg-scope`) targets management-group scope,
not resource-group scope. Container Registry is upgraded to Premium SKU to support private endpoints.
