## Agent Anatomy

Every agent definition follows a standard structure:

```yaml
# Frontmatter
---
name: 06b-Bicep CodeGen
description: Expert Azure Bicep IaC specialist...
model: ["GPT-5.5"] # (1)!
tools: [list of allowed tools] # (2)!
handoffs:
  - label: "Step 6: Deploy"
    agent: 07b-Bicep Deploy # (3)!
    prompt: "Deploy the Bicep templates..."
---
# Body (≤ 500 lines)
## MANDATORY: Read Skills First
1. **Read** `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.md` # (4)!
2. **Read** `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/SKILL.md`
```

1. Model selection — the Orchestrator can override this based on task complexity
2. Tool allowlist — agents only access tools they need
3. Handoff target — the next agent in the workflow
4. Skills are loaded on demand to preserve context budget

The frontmatter is machine-readable metadata. The body is the agent's full operating
manual — the runtime loads it into the system prompt at invocation.

### Tools

Agents interact with external systems through **tools** — structured interfaces provided
by MCP servers and the VS Code runtime. Each agent's frontmatter declares a `tools:`
allowlist that restricts which tools it can call. Common tool categories:

- **MCP tools**: Cloud API wrappers (Azure pricing queries, GitHub operations, Terraform registry lookups)
- **File tools**: Read and write workspace files (create artifacts, read prior step outputs)
- **Terminal tools**: Execute CLI commands (Bicep build, Terraform validate, Azure CLI)
- **Subagent tools**: Delegate to specialised subagents via `#runSubagent`

### Handoffs

Agents do not communicate directly. Instead, each agent produces **artifact files**
in `agent-output/{project}/` that the next agent reads as input. The Orchestrator
orchestrates this by delegating to one agent at a time, collecting its output,
and routing to the next step. At approval gates, the Orchestrator writes a
`00-handoff.md` summary document that enables session resume.

For a live, always-current roster, see the
[Architecture Explorer](../../reference/architecture-explorer/). The count is
computed from `tools/registry/count-manifest.json` and the source of truth is the
`.github/agents/*.agent.md` files on disk.

:::note[Fast Path Variant]
01-Orchestrator (Fast Path) is an experimental variant for simple projects
(≤3 resources, single environment, no custom policies). For standard or
complex projects, use the main 01-Orchestrator.

## Subagents

Subagents are not user-invocable. They are delegated to by parent agents for isolated,
specific tasks:

| Subagent                    | Purpose                            | Invoked By          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| challenger-review-subagent  | Adversarial review of artifacts    | Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 |
| cost-estimate-subagent      | Azure Pricing MCP queries          | Steps 2, 7          |
| bicep-validate-subagent     | Lint + AVM/security code review    | Step 5 (Bicep)      |
| bicep-whatif-subagent       | `az deployment what-if` preview    | Step 6 (Bicep)      |
| terraform-validate-subagent | Lint + AVM-TF/security code review | Step 5 (Terraform)  |
| terraform-plan-subagent     | `terraform plan` preview           | Step 6 (Terraform)  |

## The Challenger Pattern

:::note[Adversarial Review]
The Challenger finds what everyone else missed — untested assumptions,
governance gaps, WAF blind spots, and architectural weaknesses.
:::

The `challenger-review-subagent` implements adversarial review at critical workflow steps.
It operates with rotating lenses:

:::note[Challenger Selection Rules]
Pass 1 (security-governance) always uses `challenger-review-subagent`.
Additional passes also use `challenger-review-subagent` for
architecture-reliability and cost-feasibility lenses.
See `.github/skills/azure-defaults/references/challenger-selection-rules.md`
for the full routing table and conditional skip rules.
:::

- **1-pass review** (comprehensive): A single review covering all dimensions. This is the
  **default for all steps**. Used for requirements (Step 1), architecture (Step 2), deploy (Step 6),
  and optionally for planning (Step 4) and code (Step 5).
- **Multi-pass review** (rotating lenses, opt-in): Multiple separate reviews, each focused on a
  specific dimension (security, reliability, cost). Available for architecture (Step 2),
  planning (Step 4), and code (Step 5) when explicitly requested. Recommended for complex projects.

Findings are classified as `must_fix` (blocking) or `should_fix` (advisory). Only
`must_fix` findings block workflow progression.

**Conditional passes (when multi-pass is opted in)**: Pass 3 of the rotating lens review is
conditional — it only runs if Pass 2 returned ≥1 `must_fix` finding. If Pass 2 returns zero
`must_fix` items, Pass 3 is skipped entirely, saving approximately 4 minutes per review cycle.

**Context Shredding for Challenger Inputs**: The challenger is instructed to apply
context compression tiers when loading predecessor artefacts for review:

| Context Usage | Loading Strategy                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 60%         | Full artefact                                                  |
| 60–80%        | Key H2 sections only (resource list, SKUs, WAF scores, budget) |
| > 80%         | Decision summary from `00-session-state.json` + resource list  |

:::caution[Reliability note]
The tier selection above depends on the LLM estimating its own context usage —
there is no runtime API to measure actual token consumption. The LLM may not
apply compression consistently. The **`compact_for_parent` carry-forward** (below)
is the part that reliably works because it is a structural contract in the
subagent's JSON output format, not a voluntary LLM behaviour.
:::

After each review pass, only the `compact_for_parent` string (~200 characters) is carried
forward — not the full JSON findings. This prevents context bloat across multi-pass reviews
and is enforced by the output schema.

:::tip[If a challenger review hangs]
If a review takes >10 minutes with no output, restart the chat session and
resume from the failed gate. Use `00-session-state.json` to verify the last
completed step.
:::

**New Challenger Checklists**: Two mandatory checklist categories were added:

- **Cost Monitoring**: Budget resource, forecast alerts at 80/100/120%, anomaly detection.
- **Repeatability**: Parameterised values, multi-tenant deploy, `projectName` required.

## Handoffs and Delegation

Agents communicate through artefact files, not direct message passing. The Orchestrator
delegates to a step agent, which produces output files in `agent-output/{project}/`.
The next agent reads those files as input. This design:

- Eliminates context leakage between agents
- Enables resume from any point (artefacts are persistent)
- Allows human review at every gate (artefacts are human-readable markdown)
- Supports parallel development of different steps

**Phase Handoff Document**: At each approval gate, the Orchestrator writes a
`00-handoff.md` file containing a summary of what was completed, key decisions
made, what comes next, and (at Gates 2 and 3) a session break recommendation.
This enables resume from any gate without needing to re-read all prior artefacts.

## Creating a Custom Agent

This section walks through creating a new agent from scratch.

### Step 1: Choose Agent Type and Model

| Type            | File Location                               | User-Invocable | Use When                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Top-level agent | `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md`            | Yes            | User-facing workflow steps                |
| Subagent        | `.github/agents/_subagents/{name}.agent.md` | No             | Isolated tasks delegated by parent agents |

Model selection depends on the task. Use `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` as the
source of truth, but the current repo pattern is:

- **Planning agents** (accuracy-first) — typically `Claude Opus 4.7` at high reasoning effort
- **Orchestrator + Fast Path** — `GPT-5.5` with the OpenAI outcome-first prompting style
  (Role / Personality / Goal / Success / Constraints / Output / Stop)
- **Design + Governance + Code generation + Challenger** — `GPT-5.5` for balanced
  execution quality with explicit retrieval budgets and stopping conditions
- **Execution, deploy, and validation subagents** — model varies; consult `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`
- **Adversarial review** — use a different model family than the artifact author when possible

### Step 2: Create the Agent File

Create a `.agent.md` file with the required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: My Custom Agent
description: >-
  One-line description of what this agent does.
  USE FOR: keyword triggers. DO NOT USE FOR: anti-triggers.
model:
  - GPT-5.5
tools:
  - read_file
  - create_file
  - replace_string_in_file
  - run_in_terminal
  - runSubagent
handoffs:
  - label: "Next Step"
    agent: next-agent-name
    prompt: "Hand off with context..."
---
```

Required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`.
Optional: `handoffs`, `user-invocable` (defaults to `true` for top-level).

See `.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md` for the
complete frontmatter specification.

### Step 3: Write the Agent Body

The body (below the frontmatter) is the agent's operating manual:

```markdown
## MANDATORY: Read Skills First

1. **Read** `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.md`

## DO (required behaviours)

- Always check for existing session state before starting
- Load skills progressively (SKILL.md first, then references/ on demand)

## DO NOT (prohibited behaviours)

- Do not skip approval gates
- Do not hardcode project-specific values
```

Keep the body under 350 lines. Use skill references for deep domain
knowledge rather than inlining it.

### Step 4: Register the Agent

Update the registry file:

1. **`tools/registry/agent-registry.json`** — add the agent's role, file path,
   model, and skill list

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
# Validate frontmatter syntax, body size, and language quality
npm run validate:agents

# Verify registry consistency
npm run validate:agent-registry
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Cause                           | Fix                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent not appearing in chat | Missing or invalid frontmatter  | Run `npm run validate:agents`                       |
| Tool not available          | Tool not in `tools:` allowlist  | Add the tool name to frontmatter                    |
| Handoff not triggering      | Wrong agent name in `handoffs:` | Verify target agent file exists                     |
| Skills not loading          | Typo in skill path              | Check path matches `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
