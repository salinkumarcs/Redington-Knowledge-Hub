:::note[Template repository]
You do **not** clone this repository directly. Instead, you create your own
repository from the
[Accelerator template](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator),
which gives you a clean starting point with all agents, skills, and dev container
configuration ready to go.

## Prerequisites

:::note[What you need]
Items marked ⭐ are required for learning. An Azure subscription is optional — you only need it
when deploying to Azure in Step 6.

:::note[Docker is required]
A Docker-compatible runtime is needed for the dev container. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
is the most common choice. Free alternatives include [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/),
[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) (macOS), and [Podman](https://podman.io/) (Linux/macOS).
See [Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/) for detailed installation options.
:::

:::tip[If the dev container fails to build]

1. Check the VS Code terminal for error messages
2. Verify Docker is running (`docker ps` should succeed)
3. Follow recovery steps in [Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/)
   and [Troubleshooting](../../guides/troubleshooting/)

Most setup failures happen before APEX itself starts.
:::

:::caution[Configure `GH_TOKEN` before you open the container]
GitHub operations inside the devcontainer depend on a fine-grained Personal Access Token exposed as
`GH_TOKEN` through **VS Code User Settings**. Shell exports inside the container are not reliable and
do not survive rebuilds. The full setup is documented on [Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/),
but the minimum working configuration is included below so you do not miss it.
:::

## Step 1: Create Your Repository from the Template

1. Go to the
   [Accelerator template repository](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/azure-agentic-infraops-accelerator)
2. Click the green **"Use this template"** button → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Choose an owner and repository name (e.g. `my-infraops-project`)
4. Select **Public** or **Private** visibility
5. Click **Create repository**

:::tip[What is a template repository?]
A [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
creates a brand-new repository with the same directory structure and files — but
with a clean commit history and no fork relationship. Your repo is entirely yours.
:::

## Step 2: Clone and Open

Clone **your new repository** (not this upstream project):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-infraops-project.git # (1)!
code my-infraops-project
```

1. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME/my-infraops-project` with your actual
   GitHub username and the repository name you chose in Step 1.

## Step 3: Open in Dev Container

:::tip[What is a dev container?]
A [dev container](https://containers.dev/) is a pre-configured development environment
that runs inside a Docker container. It ensures every contributor has identical tools,
extensions, and settings — no manual setup required. See the
[Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/) page for details.
:::

1. Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for setup

The Dev Container installs all tools automatically:

- Azure CLI + Bicep CLI
- Terraform CLI + TFLint
- PowerShell 7
- Python 3 + diagrams library
- Go (Terraform MCP server)
- `apex-recall` CLI (session recall)
- Comprehensive set of VS Code extensions

## Step 4: Set Up Azure (Optional)

If you plan to deploy to Azure or run the governance baseline workflow, configure
your Azure environment with a single command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This creates an Entra ID app registration, OIDC federated credentials, RBAC
roles, and GitHub secrets/variables. See [Azure Setup](../azure-setup/) for
details and manual alternatives.

:::note[Skip this if you are just learning]
Azure setup is only required for Step 6 (Deploy) and the governance baseline
workflow. You can explore the full agent workflow without it.
:::

## Step 5: Configure `GH_TOKEN` for the Dev Container

This step is easy to miss, but it is required for reliable GitHub CLI and repository operations in
the devcontainer.

:::caution[Use VS Code User Settings, not `export GH_TOKEN=...`]
Set `GH_TOKEN` in **VS Code User Settings** so the devcontainer can forward it automatically.
Adding it in `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or an in-container shell session does not persist reliably.
:::

1. Create a **fine-grained** GitHub Personal Access Token
2. Grant at least these permissions:

| Permission    | Level      |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Contents      | Read/Write |
| Metadata      | Read       |
| Pull requests | Read/Write |
| Issues        | Read/Write |
| Workflows     | Read/Write |

1. Open **VS Code User Settings (JSON)**
2. Add this entry and replace the placeholder token value:

```jsonc
"terminal.integrated.env.linux": { "GH_TOKEN": "github_pat_your_token_here" }
```

1. Rebuild the devcontainer: `F1` → `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`
2. Run `gh auth status` inside the container and confirm it shows a logged-in token-based
   session

See [Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/) for the full explanation, screenshots, and token
rotation guidance.

## Step 6: Verify Setup

:::tip[Verify all tools installed correctly]
Run these commands to confirm the dev container has all required CLIs and GitHub authentication:
:::

```bash
gh auth status
az --version && bicep --version && terraform --version && pwsh --version # (1)!
```

1. `gh auth status` should show a token-backed login, and all four CLIs should print
   version numbers. If any fail, rebuild or reopen the dev container.

## Step 7: Enable Subagent Orchestration

:::caution[Required]
The Orchestrator pattern requires this setting.
:::

Without this setting, the Orchestrator cannot delegate to specialized agents,
so multi-step workflows will stall after the first response.

Add this to your **VS Code User Settings** (`Ctrl+,` → Settings JSON):

```json
{
  "chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true // (1)!
}
```

1. This must be in **User Settings**, not Workspace Settings.
   Experimental features require user-level configuration.

**Why User Settings?** Workspace settings exist in `.vscode/settings.json`, but user settings
take precedence for experimental features like subagent invocation.

**Verify it's enabled:**

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type: `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`
3. Confirm the setting is present

## Step 8: Start the Orchestrator

### Option A: Orchestrator (Recommended)

The Orchestrator (🧠 Orchestrator) orchestrates the complete multi-step workflow:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open Copilot Chat
2. Select **Orchestrator** from the agent dropdown
3. Describe your project:

```text
Create a simple web app in Azure with:
- App Service for web frontend
- Azure SQL Database for data
- Key Vault for secrets
- Region: swedencentral
- Environment: dev
- Project name: my-webapp
```

The Orchestrator guides you through all steps with approval gates.

### Option B: Direct Agent Invocation

Invoke agents directly for specific tasks:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to open the agent picker
2. Select the specific agent (e.g., `requirements`)
3. Enter your prompt

## Step 9: Follow the Workflow

The agents work in sequence with handoffs. Steps 1-3.5 and 7 are shared;
steps 4-6 route to **Bicep** or **Terraform** agents based on your `iac_tool` selection
in Step 1. During requirements gathering, the Requirements agent asks which IaC tool
you prefer — this choice determines which planning, code generation, and deployment
agents the Orchestrator invokes.

Each agent has a thematic codename for easy reference in documentation and prompts.

| Step | Agent                                 | Codename      | What Happens                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | `requirements`                        | 📜 Scribe     | Captures requirements       |
| 2    | `architect`                           | 🏛️ Oracle     | WAF assessment              |
| 3    | `design`                              | 🎨 Artisan    | Diagrams/ADRs (optional)    |
| 3.5  | `governance`                          | 🛡️ Warden     | Policy discovery/compliance |
| 4    | `iac-planner`                         | 📐 Strategist | Implementation plan         |
| 5    | `bicep-codegen` / `terraform-codegen` | ⚒️ Forge      | IaC templates               |
| 6    | `bicep-deploy` / `terraform-deploy`   | 🚀 Envoy      | Azure deployment            |
| 7    | `as-built`                            | 📚 Chronicler | Documentation suite         |

**Approval Gates**: The Orchestrator pauses at key points:

- ⛔ **Gate 1**: After requirements (Step 1) — confirm requirements
- ⛔ **Gate 2**: After architecture (Step 2) — approve WAF assessment
- ⛔ **Gate 2.5**: After governance (Step 3.5) — approve governance constraints
- ⛔ **Gate 3**: After planning (Step 4) — approve implementation plan
- ⛔ **Gate 4**: After validation (Step 5) — approve preflight results
- ⛔ **Gate 5**: After deployment (Step 6) — verify resources

:::tip[If a gate rejects your proposal]
If the Challenger or an approval gate produces `must_fix` findings, return to the
previous step, update your approach based on the feedback, and re-run. The Orchestrator
will re-execute the step and re-trigger the gate. Use the artifact files in
`agent-output/{project}/` to understand what was flagged.
:::

### If a Step Fails

- **Governance returns no policies**: continue if `04-governance-constraints.json`
  shows `discovery_status: "COMPLETE"`. An empty policy list means no deny-effect
  constraints were found for that scope.
- **Pricing, auth, or tooling fails**: fix the environment first, then resume the same step.
  Start with [Troubleshooting](../../guides/troubleshooting/) and
  [Dev Container Setup](../dev-containers/).
- **Security or cost findings block progress**: update the generated plan or code,
  then re-run the same step with the exact failing output so the agent can repair it.

Before you deploy, review the mandatory guidance in
[Security Baseline](../../guides/security-baseline/) and
[Cost Governance](../../guides/cost-governance/).
