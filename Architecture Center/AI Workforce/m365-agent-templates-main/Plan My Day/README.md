## 💡 Overview

The **Plan My Day Agent** is a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot that creates a personalized daily briefing from your work data — calendar, email, Teams messages, files, and contacts — so you can start every day knowing exactly what to focus on. With one simple prompt, users get a structured "digital day folder" that replaces the fragmented morning ritual of scanning multiple tools.

The agent orchestrates data retrieval across Microsoft 365, evaluating what's relevant across today, the next working day, and the days ahead. It synthesizes meetings, priorities, pending decisions, urgent communications, documents awaiting review, and even personal celebrations into a three-depth briefing: a 30-second glance, a 1-minute read, and a deep read — ensuring every user begins the day prepared, aligned, and focused.

## ⚡ How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|:----:|:-------------|
| **1** | 💬 User asks the agent to **"Plan my day"** (or clicks a suggested prompt button) |
| **2** | 🔍 Agent retrieves data from **Outlook Calendar, Email, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint** across today, the next working day, and the next 3 working days |
| **3** | 🧠 Agent **cross-references and enriches** — flagging meetings with unopened docs, identifying pending decisions, detecting conflicts, and surfacing focus blocks |
| **4** | 📋 A structured **three-depth briefing** is delivered: 30-Second Glance → 1-Minute Read → Deep Read, with urgency tags and direct links to every item |

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

1. **Microsoft 365 Copilot License** — Required for all users interacting with the agent and to access organizational data (email, calendar, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive)
2. **Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or Business Premium** — Base subscription providing access to Microsoft 365 services
3. **Sideloading Enabled in Teams** *(Option A & C only)* — A Teams admin must enable **Upload custom apps** in the Teams Admin Center under **Setup Policies > Global**

---

### 📦 Option A — Import the Agent into Teams

This is the fastest way to get started. You'll upload the pre-built agent package directly into Teams.

> 🔴 **Important:** Do not unzip or rename the `.zip` file. Teams needs the original `.zip` as-is.

**Before You Begin:**

| ✓ | What You Need | Why |
|:-:|:--------------|:----|
| ☐ | Microsoft Teams installed (desktop app or [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com)) | The agent is uploaded through the Teams app |
| ☐ | Custom app uploading enabled in Teams | Your admin must turn this on — see below |
| ☐ | `PlanMyDay_v1.0.0.0.zip` file downloaded from this repository | The agent package you'll upload |

<details>
<summary>🔍 How to Check if Custom App Uploading Is Enabled</summary>

1. Open Teams and click **Apps** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Manage your apps** at the bottom.
3. Look for an **Upload an app** button.

✅ See the button? You're good to go.
❌ Don't see it? Ask your IT admin to enable **"Upload custom apps"** in the Teams Admin Center under **Setup Policies > Global**.

</details>

**Upload the Agent:**

1. Open **Microsoft Teams** (desktop app or [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com)).
2. Click **Apps** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Manage your apps** (bottom of the page).
4. Click **Upload an app** → **Upload a custom app**.
5. Select the `PlanMyDay_v1.0.0.0.zip` file from your computer.
6. Click **Add** when the app details appear.

✅ The agent is now installed!

**Open the Agent:**

| Method | How |
|:-------|:----|
| **Copilot Web** | Go to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) → click the side-panel icon next to New Chat → select **Plan My Day** |
| **Teams** | Open Teams → click **Copilot** in the sidebar → click the side-panel icon → select **Plan My Day** |
| **@Mention** | In any Copilot chat, type `@Plan My Day` followed by your question |

> 💡 **Pin it!** Right-click Plan My Day in the agent list and select **Pin** to add it to your sidebar for instant access.

<details>
<summary>🔧 Troubleshooting (Option A)</summary>

| Problem | Fix |
|:--------|:----|
| "Upload an app" button missing | Custom app uploading is disabled. Ask your IT admin to enable it. |
| "Parsing has failed" error | The zip file may be corrupted. Re-download the original file and try again. Make sure you didn't extract or modify it. |
| App doesn't appear after upload | Wait 1–2 minutes, then refresh Teams. Check **Manage your apps** to confirm it's listed. |
| Agent not showing in Copilot | It can take a few minutes after upload for the agent to appear in the Copilot agent list. Refresh the page and check again. |

</details>

---

### 🏗️ Option B — Build the Agent Yourself

If you can't upload a zip — or prefer to build it yourself — use Agent Builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot. No coding required.

**Before You Begin:**

| ✓ | What You Need | Why |
|:-:|:--------------|:----|
| ☐ | Access to Agent Builder at [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) | Where you'll build the agent from scratch |

**Open Agent Builder:**

1. Go to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) and sign in.
2. Click **New agent** in the left pane.
3. Click **Skip to configure** (top right).

**Fill In the Configuration:**

**Name & Description:**

| Field | What to Enter |
|:------|:-------------|
| **Name** | Plan My Day |
| **Description** | Compiles a comprehensive morning briefing using Microsoft 365 data. It balances business priorities with personal wellness, helping everyone start each day informed, prepared, and connected to what matters. |

**Instructions:**

Scroll down to the **Instructions** box and paste the full agent instructions below:

```
# Plan My Day Agent

You are Plan My Day, an exec briefing assistant. Compile a forward-looking daily
briefing from M365 data covering today, the next working day (NWD), and the next
3 working days. Never limit to today alone. Warm, efficient tone — like a chief
of staff. Link every item. Omit empty sections.

Always display the briefing date at the top of every response:
"📅 Briefing for [Day], [Date]"
If after 6 PM → default to tomorrow.
If weekend → brief for Monday.

## Rules
- Use deep reasoning to retrieve content across multiple working days.
- Every item: "What do I do, and why now?" with a direct link.
- Balance business priorities with personal well-being.
- No data = no section.

## Orchestration — Four Phases

### Phase 1 — Context
- Get user's local time, day of week, time zone, nearby holidays.
- Detect work week from locale/calendar. Compute NWD and next 3 working days.
- Set retrieval windows for Today (full detail), NWD (first meeting, prep-required,
  hard deadlines), and Next 3 WD (personal events, approaching deadlines, approvals
  ageing >2 days, external meetings).
- First day of work week: weekly look-ahead, milestones, team OOO.
- Travel within 48 hrs → activate Travel Mode.

### Phase 2 — Retrieve
Fetch all sources in parallel:
- Meetings: all events with title, time, attendees, join link, docs, RSVP status.
- Email: unread + flagged + high-importance; VIP/C-suite; action words.
- Teams: mentions, DMs, followed channels; flag priority notifications.
- OneDrive/SharePoint: shared last 48 hrs, pending approvals, docs in invites.
- People: birthdays, anniversaries, OOO attendees.

### Phase 3 — Enrich
- Prep audit: flag meetings <2 hrs away with unopened docs.
- Decision queue: items where someone waits on user. Longest-wait-first.
- Conflicts: overlaps and double-bookings. Propose decline/shorten/delegate.
- Focus blocks: gaps ≥30 min → suggest focus work.
- Dedup: same topic across email + Teams + calendar → merge.
- Trending: items escalating across days.

### Phase 4 — Score & Assemble
Score on: business impact · people blocked · time sensitivity · strategic alignment.
Classify: ⚡ URGENT · 🔴 CRITICAL DECISION · 🎯 HIGH IMPACT · 📅 UPCOMING · ℹ️ AWARENESS.

## Output — Three Depths

### 30-SEC GLANCE
- 🎯 Top 3–5 priorities: label + action + why now.
- 📊 Stats: meetings today · meetings NWD · focus hrs · decisions pending.
- 👀 NWD preview: first meeting + deadlines.

### 1-MIN READ
- 📅 Schedule: chronological, location, attendees, prep links, conflict flags.
- ✅ Decisions & Approvals: who's blocked, wait time, link.
- 🎂 Personal: celebrations + family events.

### DEEP READ
- ✉️ Urgent emails + Teams needing response.
- 📂 Docs needing review (links).
- 🔔 Awareness: OOO, business context, external factors.
- 💡 3–5 Recommendations: delegate, prep, follow up, recognize.
- 📋 Summary: 3–4 sentences incl. forward look.
- 📅 NWD & Ahead: NWD schedule, overnight/weekend prep, 3-WD deadlines.

## Special Modes
✈️ Travel: time zones, conflicts, pre-departure tasks.
🔴 High-Stakes: extra prep, countdowns.
🚨 Crisis: elevate related, suggest cancellations.
📈 Busy (>6 meetings): aggressive filter, suggest delegation.
```

---

### 🧪 Test That It Works

Run these quick checks after setup to make sure everything is connected:

| # | Try This Prompt | What to Look For |
|:-:|:---------------|:-----------------|
| 1 | **Plan my day** | Pulls data from calendar, email, Teams, files, and people — delivers a structured three-depth briefing |
| 2 | **What are my top priorities today?** | Returns 3–5 prioritized items with urgency tags (⚡🔴🎯) |
| 3 | **Do I have any pending decisions?** | Shows actionable items where others are waiting on your input |
| 4 | **Give me a weekly look-ahead** | Displays upcoming events, milestones, and deadlines for the full week |
| 5 | **What should I delegate today?** | Offers delegation suggestions based on your meeting load and task list |

> ⚠️ If the agent doesn't return data for a specific source (e.g., no Teams messages), that's OK — it only shows sections where data exists.
>
> 📋 For a comprehensive evaluation, see the **Plan My Day Agent - Evaluation Test Plan.pdf** included in this repository.
