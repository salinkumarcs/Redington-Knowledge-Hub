## 💡 What Are Agent Templates?

Agent templates are **pre-configured, deploy-ready AI agents** for Microsoft 365 designed to address common workplace scenarios — from daily planning to policy lookup to request tracking to customer research. Each template ships as a complete package that you can deploy in minutes or customize to fit your organization's needs.

This repository includes two types of agents:

- **Declarative Agents (DAs)** — Lightweight agents that run inside Microsoft 365 Copilot, grounded in your organization's data (SharePoint, email, Teams, calendar, and more). No custom code or Copilot Studio license required.
- **Custom Agents (CAs)** — Full-featured agents built in Copilot Studio with topics, Power Automate flows, and connector integrations for more complex workflows.

### 📦 What's Included with Each Agent

Each agent folder contains a full **Bill of Materials (BOM)**:

| Asset | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| 📊 **Overview Deck** | Scenario overview, architecture, personas, and demo prompts |
| 📘 **Setup Guide** | Step-by-step deployment instructions tailored to the agent's platform |
| 🧪 **Evaluation Test Plan** | Test scenarios with expected results and pass/fail criteria |
| 📦 **Agent Package (.zip)** | Pre-built package ready to deploy |
| 📂 **Sample Files** | Sample data files for testing (where applicable) |
