## 💡 Overview

The **Executive Briefing Agent** is a **Declarative Agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot** that automates the full briefing lifecycle — from pre-meeting prep to post-meeting follow-through.

Instead of manually stitching together information, executives simply ask Copilot to generate a briefing. The agent **synthesizes content across your Microsoft 365 ecosystem** — Outlook Calendar, Email, Teams messages, SharePoint documents, and OneDrive files — into **structured, ready-to-use briefing documents**.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| 📄 **Pre-Meeting Talking Points** | Generates structured talking points aligned to upcoming meeting agendas by pulling from calendar events, related emails, and prior documents |
| 📋 **Executive Briefing Documents** | Creates concise, one-page executive briefs summarizing the current state of projects, initiatives, or strategic topics |
| ✍️ **Post-Meeting Summaries** | Produces executive summaries from meeting transcripts, highlighting key decisions, owners, and follow-up actions |
| ✅ **Action Item Extraction** | Identifies and lists action items with owners and deadlines from meeting transcripts and follow-up emails |
| 🎤 **Interview Preparation** | Builds media/interview prep packages with key messages, supporting points, and anticipated Q&A |
| 📢 **Public & Media Prep** | Generates talking points, key messages, and Q&A documents for speaking engagements, panels, and public appearances |
| 📝 **Briefing Document Drafting** | Creates shareable Word briefing documents with overview, discussion points, and recommended actions |

---

## ⚡ How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|:----:|:-------------|
| **1** | 🗣️ The executive or EA asks Copilot for a briefing (e.g., *"Prepare me for tomorrow's board meeting"*) |
| **2** | 🔎 The agent evaluates what's relevant — pulls from Outlook Calendar, Email, Teams messages, SharePoint, and OneDrive |
| **3** | 🧠 It synthesizes the information into a **structured briefing document** tailored to the request type |
| **4** | 📄 The output is delivered as formatted talking points, an executive summary, or a full briefing document |

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

1. **Microsoft 365 Copilot License** — Required for all users interacting with the agent and to access SharePoint/OneDrive knowledge sources
2. **Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or Business Premium** — Base subscription for Microsoft 365 services
3. **Sideloading Enabled in Teams** — A Teams admin must enable **Upload custom apps** in the Teams Admin Center under **Setup Policies > Global**
4. **Microsoft Teams** — Desktop or web client to sideload and access the agent
5. **SharePoint & OneDrive Permissions** — Users need read access to the SharePoint sites and OneDrive content the agent will reference

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Which Option Should I Choose?

| Option | Best For | You'll Need | Time |
|:-------|:---------|:------------|:-----|
| **A – Import into Teams** | Fastest setup, non-technical users | Teams + admin-enabled custom app uploading | ~5 min |
| **B – Build in Agent Builder** | Full control, no zip needed, no admin permissions required | Agent Builder access via M365 Copilot | ~15 min |

---

### 📦 Option A – Import the Agent into Teams

This is the fastest way to get started. You'll upload the pre-built agent package directly into Teams.

**Before You Begin:**

| ✓ | What You Need | Why |
|:-:|:--------------|:----|
| ☐ | Microsoft Teams installed | The agent is uploaded through the Teams app |
| ☐ | Custom app uploading enabled | Your admin must turn this on — see below |
| ☐ | `ExecutiveBriefingAgent_v1.0.0.0.zip` | The agent package you'll upload |

**How to Check if Custom App Uploading Is Enabled:**

1. Open Teams and click **Apps** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Manage your apps** at the bottom.
3. Look for an **Upload an app** button.

✅ See the button? You're good. ❌ Don't see it? Ask your IT admin to enable **Upload custom apps** in the Teams Admin Center under **Teams apps → Setup policies**.

**Upload the Agent:**

1. Open Microsoft Teams (desktop app or [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com)).
2. Click **Apps** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Manage your apps** (bottom of the page).
4. Click **Upload an app** → **Upload a custom app**.
5. Select the `ExecutiveBriefingAgent_v1.0.0.0.zip` file from your computer.
6. Click **Add** when the app details appear.

> 🔴 **Important:** Do not unzip or rename the file. Teams needs the original `.zip` as-is.

✅ The agent is now installed!

**Open the Agent After Uploading:**

| Method | How |
|:-------|:----|
| **Copilot Web** | Go to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) → click the side-panel icon next to New Chat → select Executive Briefing |
| **Teams** | Open Teams → click Copilot in the sidebar → click the side-panel icon → select Executive Briefing |
| **@Mention** | In any Copilot chat, type `@Executive Briefing` followed by your question |

> 📌 **Pin for Quick Access:** Right-click (or click the ⋯ menu) on the agent in the agent list and select **Pin** to add it to your sidebar.

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Troubleshooting (Option A)</strong></summary>

| Problem | Fix |
|:--------|:----|
| "Upload an app" button missing | Custom app uploading is disabled. Ask your IT admin to enable it. |
| "Parsing has failed" error | The zip file may be corrupted. Re-download and try again. Don't extract or modify it. |
| App doesn't appear after upload | Wait 1–2 minutes, then refresh Teams. Check **Manage your apps** to confirm it's listed. |
| Agent not showing in Copilot | It can take a few minutes after upload. Refresh the page and check again. |

</details>

---

### 🛠️ Option B – Build the Agent Yourself

If you can't upload a zip — or prefer to build it yourself — use Agent Builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot. No coding required.

**Before You Begin:**

| ✓ | What You Need | Why |
|:-:|:--------------|:----|
| ☐ | Agent Builder access | Available through Microsoft 365 Copilot at [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) |

**Step 1: Open Agent Builder**

1. Go to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) and sign in.
2. Click **New agent** in the left pane.
3. Click **Skip to configure** (top right).

**Step 2: Name & Description**

| Field | What to Enter |
|:------|:--------------|
| **Name** | Executive Briefing Agent |
| **Description** | Executive support agent for meetings, events and interviews. |

**Step 3: Instructions**

Scroll down to the **Instructions** box. Copy and paste the full instructions below:

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Engagement Type
- **Goal:** Determine engagement and deliverable.
- **Action:**
  - Classify the request:
    - **meeting** → Pre‑Meeting Briefing or Post‑Meeting Report
    - **public event, speech, keynote** → Event Messaging & Speech
    - **press interview, media interaction** → Interview Preparation
    - **general question** → answer in chat (max 3 bullets, no document)
  - If ambiguous, ask: "Is this for a meeting, public event, or press interview?"
- **Transition:** Proceed to Step 2 once confirmed.

### Step 2: Gather Context
- **Goal:** Collect type-specific details and get explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
- **Action by type:**
  - **Meeting:**
    - Search **Meetings** for a calendar match.
    - If found, present title, date, and participants for confirmation.
    - If no exact match, present up to four candidates by title, date, participants, or topic.
  - **Event / Speech:**
    - Ask in one message for: event name, date, audience, format, theme, and key objectives.
  - **Interview / Media:**
    - Ask in one message for: interviewee name, interviewer name, publication/outlet, media type (print, TV, podcast…), date, and topic.
  - If details are missing or unclear, ask follow-up questions until all required fields are filled.
- **Confirmation gate:** Present a summary of the gathered context and ask the user to confirm it is correct. **Do not proceed to Step 3 until the user explicitly confirms.**
- **Transition:** Proceed to Step 3 only after user confirmation.

### Step 3: Retrieve Content
- **Goal:** Build a reliable information base.
- **Action by type:**

    - Search **OneDriveAndSharePoint** for prior presentations, decks, and briefings.
    - Search **Email** (last 6 months) for related correspondence.
    - **WebSearch**: industry context, audience background, event coverage.
    - Search **TeamsMessages** for internal discussions on the topic.
    - Search **Meetings** for past events on the same topic.
  - **Interview / Media:**
    - **WebSearch**: interviewer profile, publication history, recent news, competitor stances.
    - Search **Email** for prior correspondence with the interviewer or on the topic.
    - Search **OneDriveAndSharePoint** for media kits, position papers, and approved messaging.
    - Search **TeamsMessages** for internal discussions.
    - Search **Meetings** for past briefings or events on the topic.
- **Transition:** Proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Analyze & Synthesize
- **Goal:** Produce executive‑ready insights.
- **Action:**
  - Extract themes, decisions, risks, context. Summarize concisely.
  - Identify sensitive areas; draft recommended messaging.
  - Draft anticipated questions with responses.
  - **Interview prep** additionally: interviewer profile, sentiment, common questions, competitor stances, uncomfortable areas.
- **Transition:** Proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Generate Deliverable
- **Goal:** Produce the briefing using the correct template.
- **Action:**
  - Select template by engagement type (see below). Fill each section.
  - **Speech requests**: 20‑min draft, inspirational/visionary tone. Notify user of assumed duration.
  - Present key messages for review before finalizing (event and interview types).
- **Transition:** Proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Self‑Evaluation
- **Goal:** Validate completeness before delivering.
- **Action:**
  - Confirm every template section is populated.
  - Confirm talking points are sourced from retrieved content.
  - Confirm output follows the Output Contract.
  - Flag gaps: "⚠️ Incomplete - [specific gap]."
- **Transition:** Deliver.
